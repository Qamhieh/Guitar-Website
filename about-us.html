<h1>About Us</h1>

    </header>
<p>
When i was in high school i fell in love with midwest emo music, suddenly i was tuning my guitar to a new tuning every other week , but i didn’t really have a way of keeping track of all the tunings other than scribbling notes on pieces of paper lying around.Until one night, it hit me. an online community where you can look up a tuning and instantly view all songs in that tuning! which would help you understand the tuning better instead of thinking of the chords as just weird shapes!
</p>
<p>
Also,special thanks to Sarah AlYahya, my web design professor  who tremendously helped me make my nerd dreams come true.
